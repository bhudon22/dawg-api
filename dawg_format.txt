DAWG Binary File Format (dawg.bin)
===================================

Overview:
The file contains a compressed DAWG (Directed Acyclic Word Graph) representing
a dictionary of lowercase English words (a-z only). The entire file is an array
of uint32 values (little-endian, 4 bytes each). There is no file header.

Structure:
Each uint32 entry represents an edge from a parent node to a child node.
A node's children are stored as a consecutive run of entries called a "sibling list".
The root node's children start at array index 0.

Bit Layout (per uint32 entry):
  Bits 0-4   (5 bits): Character — letter encoded as 1-26 where 1='a', 2='b', ... 26='z'. 0 is unused.
  Bit  5     (1 bit):  End of Word — 1 if traversing this edge completes a valid word.
  Bit  6     (1 bit):  End of Node — 1 if this is the last entry in the current sibling list.
  Bits 7-31  (25 bits): Next Pointer — array index where the child node's own sibling list starts.
                         0 means the child has no children (leaf).

Key Design Detail — Terminal Flag is Per-Edge:
The End of Word flag is stored on the edge (the uint32 entry), NOT on the target node.
This means multiple edges can point to the same shared child node, with some edges
marking it as word-ending and others not. This enables more subtree sharing.

How to Traverse:
1. Start at index 0 (root's first child edge).
2. Scan the sibling list: read each entry, extract the character.
   - If End of Node (bit 6) is set, this is the last sibling.
3. To follow an edge: the Next Pointer (bits 7-31) gives the index of the child's sibling list.
   - If Next Pointer is 0, the child is a leaf (no further children).
4. To check if a word is complete at this edge: check End of Word (bit 5).

Example — Looking up a word:
  For each letter in the word:
    - Scan the current sibling list for a matching character.
    - If found: check End of Word if this is the last letter.
    - If found and more letters remain: follow Next Pointer to the child's sibling list.
    - If not found (reached End of Node without matching): word is not in the dictionary.

Bit Extraction (C# examples):
  uint char_val  = (entry)       & 0x1F;        // 1-26
  char letter    = (char)('a' + char_val - 1);   // 'a'-'z'
  bool eow       = ((entry >> 5) & 1) == 1;      // end of word
  bool eon       = ((entry >> 6) & 1) == 1;      // end of sibling list
  uint next      = (entry >> 7)  & 0x1FFFFFF;    // child index
