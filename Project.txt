# Project Brief: DAWG Word API

## Context

We have an existing C# DAWG (Directed Acyclic Word Graph) loader that reads a pre-built binary dictionary file. We want to wrap it in a simple ASP.NET Core minimal API to enable pattern-based word queries.

## Existing Work

- **DAWG compressor**: written in C, compresses a 370k English word dictionary
- **Source dictionary**: 4.5MB plain text file (~370,000 English words)
- **Output**: 1.4MB binary file of packed unsigned 32-bit integers
- **C# loader**: already written, reads the binary DAWG file and supports pattern matching
- **Example query**: find all 5-letter words ending in “er” → pattern `???er`

## Node Structure

Each node is a packed uint32 containing:

- Character value
- End-of-word flag
- Last-child flag
- Child node offset/index

## Goal

Wrap the existing C# DAWG loader into an **ASP.NET Core minimal API** with a simple REST endpoint:

```
GET /words?pattern=???er
```

Returns a JSON array of all matching words.

## Steps to Implement

1. Create new project: `dotnet new web -n WordApi`
1. Integrate existing DAWG loader as a singleton service
1. Add pattern matching endpoint
1. Test locally with `dotnet run` (Kestrel on localhost:5000)

## Key Decisions

- Use ASP.NET Core minimal API (not MVC) — clean and lightweight
- Use dependency injection for the DAWG loader service
- `?` represents a wildcard single character in patterns
- Possibly support `*` for variable length wildcards later

## Notes

- This could eventually serve as a backend for a MonoGame word game
- Keep it simple for now — local hosting with `dotnet run` is sufficient
